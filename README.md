# Project title

Welcome to React Project __Game__ _"Tic tac toe"_ using Hooks,created for learning purpose. It's a game with a computer.The game consists of two levels: easy and normal. Player 'X' goes first, the second is a computer player turn 'O'. If it is your turn, just click in the position you want to play in the board. After that the computer will perform its move. Once the game has a winner or there is a draw, you will see a dialog informing about the result. From here you can: click the reset button.

___Open [Tic Tac Toe](https://oksanakis.github.io/my_gameTicTacToe/) to view it in the browser.___

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Main points

* ReactJS is a library created by Facebook to build user interfaces.
* React allows me to break down application into Components
    * components
        * Board.js
        * Square.js
    * App.js
* Components use state that will tell the component how to display.
* React uses a Virtual DOM, so having to rerender the component when state changes

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`



<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
